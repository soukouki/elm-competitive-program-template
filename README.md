# elm-competitive-programming
[EXPERIMENTAL] Template for competitive programming in Elm.

Based on https://qiita.com/ymtszw/items/d195c098445476527539, I created a template for competition programming, adapted to the ELm0.19 environment.

The logic of the program is in `update` function in `src/Worker.elm`.

When submitting, please run `npm run build` and submit `dist/main.js`.
